Yes, it makes more sense to consolidate all loss functions into a single file with a shared base class. Here's the analysis:

# Loss Functions Implementation Analysis

## Current Structure Issues
1. File Proliferation
   - Creating separate files for each loss function would lead to 8+ new files
   - Unnecessary complexity in project structure
   - More difficult to maintain and navigate

2. High Coupling
   - Loss functions share many common dependencies
   - Similar integration points
   - Related validation requirements
   - Common utility functions

3. Code Duplication
   - Common imports repeated across files
   - Shared helper functions duplicated
   - Similar testing patterns repeated

## Proposed Structure Benefits

1. Code Organization
   ```python
   # loss_functions.py
   class BaseLossFunction:
       # Shared base implementation
   
   class SharpeRatioLoss(BaseLossFunction):
       # Sharpe-specific implementation
   
   class SortinoRatioLoss(BaseLossFunction):
       # Sortino-specific implementation
   ```

2. Maintainability Improvements
   - Single import location for all loss functions
   - Centralized dependency management
   - Easier to maintain consistent interfaces
   - Simplified testing structure

3. Better Code Reuse
   - Shared utility functions in one place
   - Common validation logic in base class
   - Unified error handling
   - Consistent logging approach

4. Project Structure Alignment
   The project already follows a modular approach with focused files:
   - async_get_returns_today.py
   - get_universe_today.py
   - historical_processor.py
   - mean_reversion_backtester.py
   - option_data_downloader.py

5. Testing Benefits
   - Single test file for all loss functions
   - Shared test fixtures and utilities
   - Easier to test interactions between functions
   - More comprehensive coverage

## Implementation Recommendation

1. Create single file: `loss_functions.py`
2. Define abstract base class with shared functionality
3. Implement each loss function as a subclass
4. Use factory pattern for instantiation
5. Include shared utilities and constants
6. Centralize documentation and type hints

## Integration with Existing Code
This approach better aligns with:
- The optimization_engine.py usage patterns
- The project's modular architecture
- The existing testing framework
- The dependency management in pyproject.toml

## Conclusion
Consolidating loss functions into a single file with inheritance:
- Reduces complexity
- Improves maintainability
- Follows DRY principles
- Aligns with project structure
- Simplifies testing
- Makes the codebase more navigable

This recommendation aligns with the project's existing structure and would make the loss functions easier to maintain, test, and extend while reducing unnecessary complexity in the project organization.
