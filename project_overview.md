3. Improve trading strategy performance by finding optimal parameter combinations
4. Create a standardized, repeatable process for strategy optimization

### Success Criteria
- Successful optimization of at least 3 different trading strategies
- Reduction in parameter tuning time from days to hours
- Improved strategy performance metrics by at least 15%
- Integration with existing CI/CD pipeline

### Key Stakeholders
- Trading Strategy Developers
- Quantitative Analysts
- DevOps Team
- Risk Management Team
